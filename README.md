The server is binded to the address 0.0.0.0 and the client is binded to the address 0.0.0.80. These can be changed in the code.
In this code the client connects with the server, each time it sends a message it follows up by disconnecting and reconnecting(this was done to test if multiple clients can connect with the server)
